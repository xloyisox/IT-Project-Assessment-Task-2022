# IT-Project-Assessment-Task-2022

This application is a bakery ordering system which aims to provide a platform for a small bakery owner to be able to retrieve information about the orders she receives on a daily basis. This application will allow potential customers to be able to either sign in or sign up and order, and will allow the owner to see new customer orders. The application will provide a menu for the customer. From there on the customer will choose what they would like to order, choose to check out and choose a delivery date. The application will then show the customer their complete order, the delivery fee and the total cost.

The application will require the customer to sign up and create an account. The customer will then be required to provide some personal information, such as their name and surname, address, phone number, etc. It will also require their preferred payment method. From there, they will be able to place an order. If the customer already has an account, the customer will sign in using their email address, home address and password. From there on, they will be able to place an order.

The application will store the ownerâ€™s contact details and the address of the bakery. 

The application will have two core pages that will specify if it is the owner or if it is a customer. If it is the owner, they will sign in using their email address, password and by answering a security question for example, what was the name of their childhood street. From there on, the owner will be able to see new orders and update the menu and prices. If it is a customer, all the aforementioned about the customer will be applied.
